Bioterrorism has created a need for the rapid analysis of samples which may contain toxins, viruses, or other deadly agents. Mass Spectrometry (MS) provides a tool for use in proteomics for accurate and comprehensive profiling of proteins. An automated software tool which can search for matches against a proteome database is useful for forensic analysis of samples and an effective countermeasure to Bioterrorist attacks. Here we create a database for this purpose using publicly available proteomes from the Uniprot.org database.
